/**
 * Pins the transport gate that decides whether a hardware command may run.
 *
 * The bug this fixes: on BLE-only firmware (Momentum reports "RPC-only") the
 * capability probe cannot reach the serial CLI, so supportsRpc is derived as
 * false even though RPC works — and every connection reset clears it to false
 * too. The old gate refused any command in that state, so transmit / emulate /
 * launch were blocked before the RPC bridge was ever tried, surfacing as
 * "automation transport unavailable" while RPC was in fact live.
 *
 * The rule now: a command with an RPC mapping is routed via the bridge whenever
 * the transport is not explicitly torn down, regardless of the probe-derived
 * flag. These tests fail against the old behaviour and pass against the fix.
