/**
 * Closes the app-side half of "manage apps / transmit / write scripts over BLE".
 *
 * The chain is: the model asks for an action -> CommandExecutor builds a CLI
 * command string (pinned by CommandExecutorHardwareTest) -> that string must have
 * an RPC mapping so it can run over BLE, where there is no text CLI -> the RPC
 * bridge sends an AppStartRequest (execution path read and verified sound).
 *
 * This test pins the middle link: every command string the executor produces for
 * a hardware action resolves to an RPC mapping AND, on RPC-only firmware, routes
 * via the RPC app bridge rather than being refused. With this, the only unproven
 * link left is the physical Flipper acting on the AppStartRequest — which needs
 * the real device over BLE and cannot be exercised in a unit test.
